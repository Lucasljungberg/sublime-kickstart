# Sublime package kickstart-syntax

Very simple syntax definitions for [Kickstart files](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/sect-kickstart-syntax).
The syntax has been adapted from the syntax definition in Visual Studio Code plugin [kickstart-language-support](https://github.com/95jonpet/kickstart-language-support/tree/main), so the author deserves the credit for defining the TMLanguage scope names.
